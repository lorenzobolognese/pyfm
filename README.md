# pyfm
Python Footbal Manager

# Description
Simple football simulator where all 20 2019/2020 Italian Serie A's teams play against each other (home and away). All the clubs are managed by the CPU; user interaction is actually limited to setup team's rosters, tactics and chariness at the beginning of the league.

About "chariness": it may take 3 levels:
 1 - team will try to find the goal frequently exponing itself to counter-attack risks
 2 - team will keep often the ball possession
 3 - team will limit its attitude to attack to prevent the risk to lose the ball possession
